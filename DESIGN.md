Design
======

The via-httplib library consists of three parts:  
* An HTTP parser/encoder in namespace via::http  
* Tcp and Ssl communications software in namespace via::comms  
* Tcp and Ssl HTTP servers in namespace via  

The parser/encoder in via::http is completely independent of the communications
code in via::comms. They have been designed to provide a foundation for the
servers in the via namespace, but they can be used on their own if that is all
thatâ€™s required.

The HTTP parsing/encoding library via::http
===========================================

Requirements
------------

The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is a text based application level
messaging protocol.

A client sends a request message to a server to obtain or modify a resource.
A server sends a response message back to the client, either with the resource
or a reason why it hasn't responded as requested.

The protocol has three types of message:  
1.	A request, sent from a client to a server.  
2.	A response, sent from a server to a client.  
3.	A chunk, a chunk of data which may be part of a request or a response.  

And four types of header:  
1.	A request start line, e.g. GET /blah/blah HTTP/1.1\r\n  
2.	A response start line, e.g. HTTP/1.1 200 OK\r\n  
3.	A chunk start line, e.g. 2bf;\r\n  
4.	A message header, e.g. Content-Length: 336  

Although text based, the protocol is quite strict on what's allowed and what
isn't (see RFC2616).

A request message must always start with a request start line followed by any
number of message header lines and blank line. Some request messages may
contain data.

Likewise, a response message must always start with a response start line
followed by any number of message header lines and blank line. Also some
response messages may contain data.

Where a request or response message contains data in the body of the message,
it must have a 'Content-Length' message header containing the size in octets
(another word for bytes) of the data. Otherwise, if the data is to be sent in
chunks, the request or response message must have a 'Transfer-Encoding' message
header containing the work 'chunked'.

Where a request or response message contains chunked data, each chunk of data
must be preceded by a 'chunk' header, which is just a line before the data with
the size of the data (in a hex string).

Design
------

For efficiency and simplicity, the request and response message parsers parse
the input data one character at a time. They keep track of their current
location with the HTTP message using a state machine so that they can handle
requests and responses where an HTTP message is divided across multiple
message packets.

The parsed message headers (for both requests and responses) are stored in a
map of strings. The message header field names are converted to lower case
whilst the message header is being parsed. RFC2616 states that the header
field names are case-insensitive, so converting them all to lower case and
storing them in a map, makes searching for a specific header field relatively
simple and efficient. Note: the message header values are stored as they are
received and are NOT converted to lower-case.

The encoding message headers (for both requests and responses) are simply
stored in a (long) std::string. This allows the user to control the order in
which message headers are sent. Note: RFC2616 is a bit ambiguous over this;
it states that the headers should be sent in a certain order, but then it also
states that the receiver should care about the order...

The upshot of this is that the library has different classes for receiving and
transmitting requests and responses. The request.hpp header file contains:  
*class tx\_request for constructing an HTTP request for an HTTP client to send  
*class rx\_request for parsing an HTTP request for an HTTP server  

The response.hpp header file contains:  
*class tx\_response for constructing an HTTP response for an HTTP server to send  
*class rx\_response for parsing an HTTP response for an HTTP client  

The comms library via::comms
============================

Requirements
------------

HTTP sessions are normally implemented over the Transmission Control Protocol
(TCP). Secure HTTP sessions (HTTPS) are normally implemented using Secure
Sockets Layer (SSL) over TCP.

Therefore a HTTP server or client must implement TCP (and optionally SSL)
communications.

Design
------

The boost:asio library contains excellent code for sending and receiving
messages on TCP, SSL, UDP and other communications protocols. However, the
library does not buffer received or transmitted messages. This is good for
efficiency but makes it hard to use...

The via::comms library uses a bridge design pattern to wrap the boost::asio
socket classes with buffers for the received and transmitted messages.

The HTTP server library via
===========================

Requirements
------------

By default, the HTTP server shall implement the HTTP 1.1 protocol as defined
in RFC2616. It accepts TCP or SSL connections from HTTP clients and then
responds to each HTTP request in turn, i.e. it does not close the connection
after it has responded. However, it shall close the connection if:  
*it is responding to a request from an HTTP 1.0 (or lower) client.  
*the client requests that the server closes the connection after its response.  
*the client does not send a request within a given timeout period.
